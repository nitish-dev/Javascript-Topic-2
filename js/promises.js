//In es6 where promises has been introduced. 
//A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future: either a resolved value, or a reason that itâ€™s not resolved (e.g., a network error occurred).
//A promise is an object which can be returned synchronously from an asynchronous function. It will be in one of 3 possible states:
/*
Fulfilled: onFulfilled() will be called (e.g., resolve() was called)
Rejected: onRejected() will be called (e.g., reject() was called)
Pending: not yet fulfilled or rejected
*/ 
// Promises give you a more allegiant way to handle asynchronous data.
